# Spell Homebrew

## Comprehend Languages (Revised)

*1st-level divination (ritual)*

When you cast this spell, you draw upon a **Lingua Bond** you have established with another creature. For the duration, you understand the **literal meaning** of any spoken language that bonded creature speaks, and you understand any written language that creature can read, provided you are touching the surface on which the words are written.

It takes approximately **1 minute to read one page of text**.

You gain no understanding of languages the bonded creature does not know.

Idioms, cultural references, specialized jargon, and emotional nuance are understood **only to the extent that the bonded creature would understand them**, at the DM's discretion.

---

### Spell Failure

The bonded creature must be **conscious and metaphysically accessible** at the time the spell is cast. If the bonded creature is unable to provide linguistic understanding for any reason, the spell fails with no effect.

The spell does **not** reveal the cause of this failure.

---

## Lingua Bond

A **Lingua Bond** is a persistent magical connection that aligns one creature's perception of language with another's lived understanding. It represents an ongoing relationship of shared linguistic context, not stored knowledge.

A Lingua Bond is created by inscribing a magical tattoo during a special **10-minute ritual** derived from *comprehend languages*. The creature receiving the tattoo must be **willing**.

The bond has **no effect on its own**. It only allows the caster to draw upon the bonded creature's linguistic understanding when casting *comprehend languages*.

---

### Bond Limits

- A caster may maintain a number of Lingua Bonds equal to their **proficiency bonus** (minimum of one).
- Each creature may be bonded to **only one caster** at a time.
- Creating a new Lingua Bond beyond this limit automatically **overwrites the oldest existing bond**.
- The caster receives **no indication** when a bond is overwritten.

---

### Ending a Bond

A Lingua Bond may be ended **at will by either party** at any time. Ending a bond requires no action and provides no feedback to the other party.

A bond may also be ended by *dispel magic* or similar magic that explicitly ends ongoing magical effects.

---

### Interference and Disruption

A Lingua Bond may be **blocked, suppressed, or rendered inaccessible** by physical or magical effects that interfere with the transmission of divinatory or perceptual magic.

Such interference does not sever the bond, but prevents it from being used while the interference persists.

Examples include, but are not limited to:

- **Lead or equivalent materials** that block divinatory magic
- **Antimagic fields**
- **Spells or effects that disrupt divination, perception, or mental alignment**
- **Planar boundaries or extradimensional isolation**
- **Effects that obscure, fragment, or sever awareness or consciousness**

#### Mundane Obstruction

Ordinary physical matter does **not** block a Lingua Bond. Soil, stone, wood, water, vegetation (including trees and roots), walls, buildings, and similar natural or worked materials do **not** interfere with the bond, regardless of thickness or distance.

Only materials or effects that would normally block or disrupt **divination magic**—such as lead or explicitly anti-magical substances—can interfere with a Lingua Bond.

Whether a given effect interferes with a Lingua Bond is at the **DM's discretion**, using the same logic applied to divination spells.

---

### Optional Clarifications (DM Guidance)

- A Lingua Bond represents **access to understanding**, not acquisition of language knowledge. The caster does not learn or retain languages through the bond.
- If a casting of *comprehend languages* fails, the caster receives **no information** about whether the bonded creature is unconscious, dead, absent, planar-separated, restrained, shielded, or has willingly ended the bond.
- Language barriers in the world are intentional. Interpreters, guides, scholars, and cultural intermediaries are meant to function as **keys** that unlock places, factions, and knowledge.

---

### Design Intent

This version of *comprehend languages* treats language as **embodied, contextual knowledge** rather than abstract translation. Understanding flows through relationships and shared perception, reinforcing exploration, diplomacy, and the importance of interpreters within the setting.
